# Computational and Systems Neuroscience Lab @ KAIST
---
Dr. Byeongwook Lee’s Computational and Systems Neuroscience Lab at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) is a research group in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences that builds computational models to reveal the dynamic principles of human cognition. We integrate network science, dynamical systems, and machine learning with real-world neuroimaging and cognitive-task data to quantify how neural activity patterns are organized, maintained, compensated, or disrupted—especially in aging. Our goals are to (1) identify mechanistic biomarkers of healthy brain aging, (2) map individualized trajectories of neurocognitive function, and (3) enable data-driven, personalized interventions for neurodegenerative disorders.

Led by Dr. Lee—trained at KAIST (B.S. EE; M.S./Ph.D. Bio & Brain Engineering under Prof. Kwang-Hyun Cho) and Stanford University (postdoc with Prof. Vinod Menon)—the lab combines theory-driven modeling with translational applications to advance both fundamental neuroscience and precision brain health.
