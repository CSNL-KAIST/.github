Dr. Byeongwook Lee is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at KAIST, specializing in Computational and Systems Neuroscience.
Dr. Lee received his B.S. in Electrical Engineering and his M.S. and Ph.D. in Bio and Brain Engineering from KAIST, where he conducted graduate research under the supervision of Professor Kwang-Hyun Cho on the design principles of complex brain networks. He then completed his postdoctoral training in the Professor Vinod Menon’s laboratory at Stanford University, developing computational models to quantitatively characterize dynamic neural activity during cognitive task performance and applying them to real-world neuroimaging data.
Dr. Lee’s current research focuses on understanding the mechanisms underlying dynamic neurocognitive processes through computational approaches, with a particular emphasis on how these processes are maintained, compensated, or disrupted in aging populations.
Dr. Lee’s ultimate goal is to uncover the dynamic principles of cognitive functions in the brain, thereby advancing our fundamental understanding of the human brain and contributing to the discovery of biomarkers for healthy brain aging and the development of personalized therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases.
